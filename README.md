# payload-model-visualizer

## Viewer

It is possible to preview the payload model in the browser thanks to a JavaScript library [MeshViewer](https://github.com/ideesculture/meshviewer).

To view the drone model, run the following commands:

```
$ chmod +x viewer.sh
$ ./viewer.sh <port>
```

When the server starts, a browser will open on [http://localhost:8000/viewer](http://localhost:8000/viewer) (or on whatever port you've chosen).
